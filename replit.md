## System Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **UI Framework**: Shadcn/ui (built on Radix UI)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query)
- **Routing**: Wouter
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **UI/UX Decisions**: Responsive design for PC, tablet, and mobile; consistent color schemes (e.g., blue for focus elements); optimized layouts for different screen sizes; intuitive navigation with collapsing sidebar and smart tooltips.

### Backend
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Runtime**: Node.js with ES modules
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: Dual system (Replit Auth for dev, local auth for prod)
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL storage
- **Security**: Rate limiting, input sanitization, security headers, PBKDF2 password hashing.

### Database
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Development**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL
- **Production**: Standard PostgreSQL in Docker containers
- **Schema**: Centralized in `shared/schema.ts`
- **Migrations**: Drizzle Kit

### Core Features
- **Authentication**: Secure dual authentication for development and production environments.
- **Multi-Store Management**: Global store context for data filtering, role-based access control (admin, manager, employee, directeur), and data isolation per store.
- **Business Entities**: Manages Orders (purchase orders, deliveries, status), Deliveries (tracking, completion), Customer Orders (POS, barcode generation), Suppliers (vendor info, history), and Publicities (marketing campaigns, store participation).
- **Invoice Verification**: Automated system for verifying invoices against delivery notes, including reconciliation and duplicate prevention.
- **Task Management**: Simplified task creation, assignment, and validation with status tracking and calendar integration.
- **DLC Management**: Comprehensive management of products with use-by dates, including status tracking, validation, and alerts.
- **Database Backup**: Automated daily backups and manual backup/restore capabilities with versioning.
- **Permission System**: Hardcoded 4-role system (Admin, Manager, Employee, Directeur) with granular permissions and dynamic sidebar based on user roles.

### Data Flow
- **Request Flow**: Client (React Query) -> Express middleware (auth, security) -> Route handlers (business logic) -> Drizzle ORM (DB operations) -> Client.
- **Authentication Flow**: Replit Auth (dev) / Username/password (prod) -> Secure session management -> Role-based authorization.
- **Data Synchronization**: Real-time updates with React Query, intelligent cache invalidation, and global store context for data filtering.

### Recent Fixes (February 2025)
- **Calendar Navigation Fixed**: Corrected date picker to open on current month (August) instead of staying on July. Added `defaultMonth={selectedDate || new Date()}` and forced component refresh with key prop.
- **Production Migration Error Fixed**: Disabled automatic database migrations in `server/index.production.ts` that were causing SSL connection errors and 502 errors on startup. The webhook_url column already exists in production database.
- **Modal Webhook Selector Fixed**: Resolved z-index issues with Facture/Avoir dropdown in webhook modal using `z-[70]`, `position="popper"`, and proper form reset.
- **Production Deployment Success**: Completely removed problematic auto-migration imports and calls from production server. Application now starts successfully without 502 errors. All database columns exist and no migrations are needed.
- **French Date Localization in Tasks Module**: Corrected all date displays in the Tasks module to show in French format using date-fns French locale. Applied formats "dd MMMM yyyy Ã  HH:mm" for creation/completion dates and "dd MMMM yyyy" for due dates. Fixed TypeScript errors and null date handling with "Date inconnue" fallback.
- **CRITICAL Director Webhook Permissions Fixed**: Resolved production issue where directors couldn't send webhooks despite having correct database permissions. The `checkPermission` function in `routes.production.ts` was hardcoded to only allow admin users for `system_admin` permission, bypassing the database permission system. Replaced hardcoded role check with proper database permission verification using `getUserPermissions`. Directors now have full webhook access as intended.
